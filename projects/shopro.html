            Players can create their own cards using a special set of keywords. <br><br>

            Example: I want to make an event card called "Swimming in Money," which gives 2 ACP when used.<br>
            This card can be written as: <br> <br>

            &lt;Event "Swimming in Money" "Gain 2 ACP." [s event > gain_acp 2]> <br> <br> <!-- use css to make this text stand out more -->

            After adding this line to the cards.txt file, the card will be added to the deck and randomly assigned to a player. <br>
            Running the game, it appears in Player 2's opening hand along with some other premade cards: <br>
            <img src="example hand.png" alt="Example Hand">
            <br> <br>

            We can use the "check" command to confirm the card was properly created:<br>
            <img src="check.png" alt="Check Command">
            <br> <br>

            We can now try using our new event card by using the "event" command: <br>
            <img src="use event.png" alt="Use Event"> <br> <br>


            The message "You gained 2 ACP" is generated by the effect resolution method, meaning our new card worked. <br>
            Pressing Enter again reloads the board and updates Player 2's hand and ACP count. <br>
