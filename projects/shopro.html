            Players can create their own cards using a special set of keywords. <br><br>

            Example: I want to make an event card called "Swimming in Money," which gives 2 ACP when used.<br>
            This card can be written as: <br> <br>
            
            &lt;Event "Swimming in Money" "Gain 2 ACP." [s event > gain_acp 2]> <br> <br> <!-- use css to make this text stand out more -->

            The card is then added to the deck and randomly assigned to a player. <br>
            Running the game, it appears in Player 2's opening hand along with some other premade cards: <br>
