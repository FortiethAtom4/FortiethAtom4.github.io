<!--Question
What were the most challenging and most satisfying things about doing this assignment? -->

<body>
    Fact received using fetch():
    <p id="uselessfact"></p>
    Fact received using AJAX GET:
    <p id="uselessfact2"></p>
    <br>
    Chosen API: Useless Facts API (https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl) <br><br>
    This API, as the name implies, generates a random fun ("useless") fact with each request. <br>
    The main option i used was "language" to set the language of the random fact to English. <br>
    I kept getting facts in an unknown Scandinavian language, which I obviously cannot read. <br>
    Although this API has "useless" in the name, I think it has use as a filler for e.g. profile pages <br>
    or a way to spice up loading screens. <br> <br>

                if (req.status == 200) {
                    let txt = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
                    document.getElementById("uselessfact2").textContent = txt.text;
